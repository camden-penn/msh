Internal Organization:
  process.*:
    Defines a struct called process, which stores relevant information about running processes.
    Includes a function to_string(), which converts a struct instance into a formatted string.

  msh.*:
    Important variables:
      background_processes:
        A std::vector of processes, listing all processes currently in the background.
      variables:
        A std::map in which the keys are variable names and the values are the variables' contents.
      input_tokens, tokens:
        std::vectors containing a tokenized input line. In tokens, all variables have been resolved.

    For a description of functions, see msh.h.

Features:
  Variables can be any token.
  Impact:
    References to variables must be followed by one of the following characters: whitespace, ", or #.

  If, on compilation, easter_eggs is #define-d to be true or true-equivalent:
    The variable ^shrug is defined.
    The variable ^table_flip is defined.

Limitations:
  Does not handle piping.
  Does not include autocomplete.
  Does not remember prior commands.
  Tokens cannot include " or #, or start with ^ if they're not variables. In other words, special characters cannot be escaped.
  Ctrl-C on a child program or in the shell terminates the shell, rather than stopping just the child and moving to a new prompt.
  The only editable environment variable is PATH.
